  Generic Tile Engine for the Apple IIgs
</h1>
<p align="center">A <b>high-performance</b> library for writing <b>tile-based</b> games for the Apple IIgs personal computer in 65816 assembly langugage.  Unlock the full, 16-bit potential of the last machine of the Apple ][ line.</p>

# Introduction

The Generic Tile Engine (GTE) project is a tile engine built to exploit the unique hardware capabilities of the Apple IIgs personal computer.  It supports the Apple IIgs super hires graphics mode (320x200, 16/256 colors) and provides two full-screen independent scrolling layers along with software sprites.  The API and core functionality of the library is inspired by the graphics hardware of the NES/SMS/SNES/Genesis console era.

An overview of GTE was presented at [KansasFest 2022](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x65JymFklk).

# Building from Source

The library iscurrently implemented as a set of source files that must be compiled into a GS/OS application.  A set of example project can be found under the `demos` folder.  Each demo folder uses a `package.json` file to define the build targets and a build of each application can be created by executing a `npm run build` command.

Each demo application has a build script that also builds the toolset and copies it, along with the demo S16 application file, to the target disk image.

## Dependencies

* node
* merlin32 (1.1.10+)
* cadius

GTE uses the [merlin32](https://brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/merlin/) [1.1.10](https://github.com/digarok/merlin32/releases/tag/v1.1.10) assembler to compile its source into GS/OS OMF files and [Cadius](https://brutaldeluxe.fr/products/crossdevtools/cadius/index.html) to copy those files onto a ProDOS disk image. The paths to these tool can be set in the `package.json` file.

An empty 2MG disk image is included in `emu/Target.2mg` and is used as the default location for copying demo applications.  This image can be mounted in any IIgs emulator.
