; Timer implementation
;
; The engire provides four timer slot that can be used by one-shot or 
; recurring timers.  Each timer is given an initial tick count, a 
; reset tick count (0 = one-shot), and an action to perform.
;
; The timers handle overflow, so if a recurring timer has a tick count of 3
; and 7 VBL ticks have passed, then the timer will be fired twice and
; a tick count of 2 will be set.
;
; As such, the timers are appropriate to drive physical and other game
; behaviors at a frame-independent rate.
;
; A collection of 4 timers that are triggered when their countdown
; goes below zero.  Each timer takes up 16 bytes
;
; A timer can fire multiple times during a singular evaluation.  For example, if the
; timer delay is set to 1 and 3 VBL ticks happen, then the timer delta is -2, will fire,
; have the delay added and get -1, fire again, increment to zero, first again and then
; finally reset to 1.
;
; +0 counter         decremented by the number of ticks since last run
; +2 reset           copied into counter when triggered. 0 turns off the timer.
; +4 addr            long address of timer routine
; +8 user            8 bytes of user data space for timer state
