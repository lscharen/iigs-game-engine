; Renders a frame of animation
;
; The render function is the point of committment -- most of the APIs that set sprites and 
; update coordinates are lazy; they simply save their values and set a dirty flag in the
; DirtyBits word.
;
; This function examines the dirty bits and actually performs the work to update the code field
; and internal data structure to properly render the play field.  Then the update pipeline is
; executed.
;
; Everything is composited into the tiles in the playfield and then the screen is rendered in
; a single pass.
;
; TODO -- actually check the dirty bits and be selective on what gets updated.  For example, if
;         only the Y position changes, then we should only need to set new values on the 
;         virtual lines that were brought on screen.  If the X position only changes by one
;         byte, then we may have to change the CODE_ENTRY values or restore/set new OPCODE
;         values, but not both.

; It's important to do _ApplyBG0YPos first because it calculates the value of StartY % 208 which is
; used in all of the other loops
